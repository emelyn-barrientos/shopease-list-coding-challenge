# About ShopEase 🛒 # 

This challenge was a great exercise in state management using React.js hooks. 

I thought a database would be an overkill for the challenge, so my approach was to use the useState hook to manage the states of the lists and list items.

When investigating options for moving items between lists, I initially investigated the 'react-beautiful-dnd' library. After reading through the documentation, I decided that created a select drop down was 1) easier for me to implement, and 2) more user and accessibility friendly.
